# Hi, I'm Seth Bassetti 👋

## 🌄 About Me
I found my way into computer science whilst living in my van during a gap semester in Yosemite Valley. Looking for a way to continue learning while away from school, I tried out coding for the first time and was immediately hooked! Since then, I've been fascinated by the field of deep learning and its application to the physical sciences, specifically in the environmental realm.
