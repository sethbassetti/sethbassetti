# Hi, I'm Seth Bassetti 👋

## 🌄 About Me
I found my way into computer science while living in my van during a gap semester in Yosemite Valley. Looking for a way to keep learning while away from school, I tried coding for the first time — and was immediately hooked.

Since then, I’ve built financial software, developed deep learning systems for climate modeling, and taught college-level computer science, designing curricula and leading project-based courses. I’m especially passionate about machine learning and building systems that simulate real-world phenomena like weather and climate.
