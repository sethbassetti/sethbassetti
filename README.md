# Hi, I'm Seth Bassetti 👋

## 🌄 About Me
I found my way into computer science whilst living in my van during a gap semester in Yosemite Valley. Looking for a way to continue learning while away from school, I tried out coding for the first time and was immediately hooked! Since then, I've worked on financial software, developed deep learning systems for climate modeling, and served as an educator creating curricula and lecturing college classes. I'm passionate about machine learning and building systems that can emulate real-world phenomena such as weather and climate.
