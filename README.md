### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher and project manager who is extremely passionate about exploring the unbounded capability of deep learning!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a graduate researcher at Western Washington University, working with faculty members and climate scientists to create high fidelity simulations of our global climate!

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything deep learning! Whether it is computer vision, natural language processing, or anything else, I am always excited about discussing and learning more about these concepts!

- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned how to code while living in my van in Yosemite and have climbed El Capitan twice! Once in three days and the second time in a single 15 hour push
